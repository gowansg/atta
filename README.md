title: Another Time Tracking Application

What
===

Atta is another time tracking application.  There probably isn't much that makes atta different from other time time-tracking software, but that was never our intention. 

Atta was created with two goals in mind.  

<strike>1. To get money, get paid</strike>
1.  To replace the outdated, buggy time tracking application we use at work

2.  To expose us to a different set of languages and paradiagms we don't get to use at our day jobs.
